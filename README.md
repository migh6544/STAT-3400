Statistical Regression with R

Statistics is the study and application of (1) methods for reliably gathering and presenting information and (2) methods for drawing conclusions about the world from limited information. In this course, we will mostly be concerned with (2), which is often referred to as inferential statistics. We will learn about methods, theory, and applications of linear statistical models, covering topics such as estimation, residual diagnostics, goodness of fit, transformations, and various strategies for variable selection and model comparison. My aim in this course is to help students become proficient in the technical aspects of data analysis; but I also aim to help students identify when certain techniques are justified, and when certain techniques might lead them astray. Learning Objectives (see canvas for detailed objectives) By the end of the course, students should be able to:
1. Load a dataset into R, clean the data, and perform basic exploratory data analyses;
2. Conduct standard methods of statistical inference, including hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, and interpret the results.
3. Definethemultiplelinearregression(MLR)model,articulateimportantMLRassumptions, estimate MLR model parameters using ordinary least squares (OLS), and state/prove important properties of OLS (e.g., unbiasedness).
4. Use the MLR model to explain, predict, and infer relationships from data based on the MLR model;
5. DiagnosetheviolationofimportantMLRassumptions(e.g.,non-constantvariance),and implement possible solutions (e.g., weighted least squares);
6. Articulate the importance of, and implement model selection and shrinkage methods (e.g., AIC, ridge regression); and
7. DefineandinterprettheANOVA/ANCOVAmodels,implementandinterpretANOVA/ANCOVA in R, and describe some basic experimental designs (e.g., randomized complete block design).
